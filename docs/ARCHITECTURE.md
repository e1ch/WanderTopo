# WanderTopo Architecture

## System Overview

WanderTopo is built on a three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend (Flutter)**
   - Cross-platform mobile application
   - Material Design UI components
   - State management using Provider
   - Google Maps integration

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
   - Async request handling

3. **Core Engine (Python)**
   - Graph-based data structure
   - Topological sorting algorithms
   - Place recommendation engine
   - Trust score calculations

## Data Flow

1. User interactions trigger API calls from Flutter
2. FastAPI endpoints process requests
3. Core engine performs graph operations
4. Results flow back through API to UI

## Key Components

### Graph Engine
- Directed graph implementation
- Node: Place information
- Edge: Travel relationships
- Weighted paths for recommendations

### Recommendation System
- Trust-based scoring
- Proximity calculations
- User preference matching
- Dynamic path finding

### API Layer
- RESTful endpoints
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Error handling

## Security Considerations

- API authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Secure data storage

## Future Considerations

- Real-time updates
- Offline support
- Caching layer
- Analytics integration
