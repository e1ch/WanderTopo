# WanderTopo

> “Don’t follow a schedule — follow curiosity.”

**WanderTopo** is a graph-based, non-linear travel planning engine designed to help users explore travel destinations in a more intuitive and flexible way. Inspired by topological concepts, it breaks away from traditional linear itineraries and empowers users to choose among trusted places within a given region.

## 🔍 Why WanderTopo?

Most travel apps force users into rigid, time-based schedules. WanderTopo flips that model.

- Instead of timelines, we use a **topological map** of restaurants, attractions, and experiences.
- Each node (place) is evaluated by **trust**, **popularity**, and **context relevance** (e.g. time of day, mood, etc).
- Users can **choose dynamically** — the path is flexible, not fixed.

## 📐 Core Concepts

- **Node**: A place (e.g. café, museum, street food spot), rated by reviews, recency, and personalization factors.
- **Edge**: Distance, theme similarity, recommendation strength — this forms the basis of graph traversal.
- **Engine**: The backend AI graph engine uses public data (e.g. Google Maps reviews) and NLP to create nodes & score edges.
- **UI**: Users interact with a visual graph, selecting paths live like a decision game, not a checklist.
